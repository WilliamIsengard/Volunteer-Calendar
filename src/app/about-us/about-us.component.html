        The Volunteer Calendar was created to provide an easy way to empower
        folks to support nonprofits in their local community. We aim to remove
        barriers for volunteering to expand community involvement and better the
        world. Please explore our site and find nonprofits to support or browse
        the events calendar to find an opportunity to help that works around
        your schedule.
